# RIETAN-2000 Rev. 1.2 for Mac OS
An archive file of the Carbon application for Mac OS 8.6 or later including Mac OS X is distributed here. To grab it, click (ctrl + click in the case of Mac OS X) the mouse button on the following archive file name
rietan2000m.tbz (2003/06/03; 1.1 MB)
to display a pop-up menu and choose "Download Link to Disk", "Save this Link As...", "Save Target As...", or a corresponding item (depending on your browser). Drag and drop the downloaded file, rietan2000m.tbz, onto bin-tar-gzip, which yields a folder called 'RIETAN-2000 Folder'. The destination of that folder depends on a setting of File --> Preferences --> Extract in bin-tar-gzip. The folder may be moved to anywhere. Never uncompress the archive file with StuffIt!
Read a text file, Readme_Mac, in 'RIETAN-2000 Folder' carefully to obtain further information. If an error message "An error occurred while saving the text. System Error #-23." is displayed during the execution of rietan, refer to RIETAN-2000: Carbon Application.

The Carbon application, rietan, contained in rietan2000m.tbz is most probably the world first Rietveld-analysis program that runs native on Mac OS X with the Aqua GUI. My love toward the splendor of Mac OS X motivated me to present it so early. The obsolete Classic application of rietan is no longer distributed.

# License agreement
I somewhat hesitate to make my dirty source code open. It is, however, indispensable for debugging the program, learning techniques of crystallographic computing, and implementing new features in RIETAN-2000. I have benefitted from a number of free software packages. I am, hence, willing to deliver RIETAN-2000 as open-source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) plus additional conditions described in what follows.
Whenever original results acquired with RIETAN-2000 are published in journals, proceedings, facility reports, etc. or reported in scientific meetings with abstracts, the program name "RIETAN-2000" (or shortly "RIETAN") should explicitly be stated. Furthermore, cite the following paper:

F. Izumi and T. Ikeda, Mater. Sci. Forum, 321-324 (2000) 198-203.
Note that "321-324" is volume numbers while "198-203" is a range of pages. Only giving credit to RIETAN-2000 for Rietveld or Le Bail analysis is fine in the cases of abstracts, short reports, and so forth with limited spaces, e.g., as follows:
Structure parameters of CaTiO3 were refined by the Rietveld method from the X-ray diffraction data with RIETAN-2000.

So long as all the above conditions are satisfied, RIETAN-2000 is 'copylefted' with its source code freely available to everyone in the world. Anyone is free to copy, modify, redistribute, and sell it under the terms of the GPL. Providing pay services to users of RIETAN-2000 is welcome.

Although RIETAN-2000 has exhaustively been tested with intensity data of many compounds, it may still contain a fair number of bugs. RIETAN-2000 is distributed in the hope that it will be useful and reliable. It is, however, provided "as is'' without any warranty since I have a number of commitments on my time. There is no charge for the program, per se, whereas technical service concerning it is not free.
